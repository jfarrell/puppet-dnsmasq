# == Class: dnsmasq::config
#
# This class generates the main configuration file used by dnsmasq.  The config
# file needs to include the $dnsmasq::config_dir.
#
# NOTE: To create dnsmasq configurations in Puppet code, refer to dnsmasq::conf
# for more information.
#
# NOTE: To create dnsmasq configurations using Hiera, refer to dnsmasq::configs
# for more information.
#
# === Parameters
#
# This class inherits ::dnsmasq which means it has the same parameters, that said,
# this class should not be called directly.
#
# === Variables

== Class: dnsmasq::dhcp_hosts

This class enables support for a full hiera based dnsmasq::dhcp_host configuration.
Hiera functionality is auto enabled during the initial dnsmasq module load;
  this class is not intended to be loaded directly.

See the primary dnsmasq module documentation for usage and examples.

=== Examples

This class is not meant to be called directly, it should be loaded properly
with a `include ::dnsmasq`.

    include ::dnsmasq

The hiera needed to make the magic happen looks like:

    dnsmasq::dhcp_hosts:
      somehost.example.domain.local:
        mac: 00:11:22:33:44:55
        ip: 192.168.100.1
        aliases: somehost somehost.local
      client1.example.domain.local:
        mac: 11:22:33:44:55:66
        ip: 10.0.1.253
        aliases: client1 client1.local

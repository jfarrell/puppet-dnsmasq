# Class: dnsmasq::hosts
#
# This class enables support for a full hiera based sudoers configuration.
# Hiera functionality is auto enabled during the initial dnsmasq module load;
#   this class is not intended to be loaded directly.
#
# See the primary dnsmasq module documentation for usage and examples.
#
class dnsmasq::hosts {

  # NOTE: hiera_hash does not work as expected in a parameterized class
  #   definition; so we call it here.
